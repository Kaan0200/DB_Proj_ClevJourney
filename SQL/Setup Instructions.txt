Run intial DB setup on an empty database,

then run the initial DB DataValues to populate databases.

In order to set up your DB for use with the application you need to set up another application user.  Under security > Logins, right click, create a new user.  Give it a easy user and password (doesn't need to be real).

Then on the Server Object, this is <PCNAME\SQLEXPRESS>, right click, select properties > Security, and change the server authentication to SQL Server and Windows Authentication.  Restart the server by right clicking it.

Test that you can log into the server on your new username and password.
