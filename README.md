Just a note about some of the backend stuff:

**Traveler**
- Name
- Warmth   (Nothing's been done with this yet)
- Hunger
- Health
- Illness Chance   (Nothing's been done with this yet)
- Status_Name
- Player_Name

**Items**
- Item Name (as Item_ID)
- Type of Item (as I_Effects)
- Value (Can contribute to either Health or Hunger)
- Cures (A Status_Name.  If you consume an item that has a 'Cures' field that matches the status of one of your travelers, it will make them healthy again)
- Average Price (as Price_avg)
